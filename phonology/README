gleb.pl is a script for generating and describing phonologies and random forms following them.  The current version, v0.3, generates a limited set of phonological processes, mostly assimilatory processes among adjacent phones; it doesn't yet know about syllables or tone or sundry other things.  

I like to invoke it as
  gleb.pl -h -d -w 30 ;
that is, output in *H*TML an inventory and *d*escription of the rules and 30 sample *w*ords.  (The inventory display in particular is much better in HTML than plaintext, on account of getting to use tables.)

Refer to the command-line usage for more.

You can try a nearly-current version online at http://gleb.000024.org .
