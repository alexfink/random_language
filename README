The (unattainable, in its full scope) aim of this project is to procedurally generate an entire naturalistic conlang.  So far the following two components exist.

- morphology_categories/morphology.pl: systems of morphological contrasts (but not their forms).  Data files have been written for nouns.  

- phonology/gleb.pl: phonology, including allophony and other such processes.  
  An nearly current version of gleb is running at https://gleb.000024.org/ .
